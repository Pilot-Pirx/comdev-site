      <description>This page is for people who are reasonably comfortable with open source development models but need a helping hand finding their way around the Apache Software Foundation and our way of developing software (commonly called &amp;ldquo;The Apache Way&amp;rdquo;). For those wishing to start from the very beginning, we have a newcomers page.
Project Independence And Policies &amp;para; While not all ASF projects practice all aspects of the Apache Way in the same way, there are a number of rules that Apache projects must follow â€“ things like complying with PMC release voting, legal policy, brand policy, using mailing lists, etc.</description>

      <description>This is a collection of links to information that&amp;rsquo;s relevant to the Apache Way and Open Source in general.
Note that most of these links point to websites that are outside of the control of the Apache Software Foundation. Please contact their respective authors for more information or questions. General discussion on the dev@community.a.o list is fine of course.

Anyone can be a mentor. You just have to take a moment to encourage someone else to participate.
Here&amp;rsquo;s some concrete ways you can provide mentoring to other members of your community.</description>
