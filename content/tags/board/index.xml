      <description>Projects at the ASF offer a way to grow in your responsibilities in the project, from being a user, all the way up to being a maintainer of the project. While the specific details may look different from one project to another, the rungs of the ladder look mostly the same.

      <description>Like every other ASF project, the ComDev PMC sends a quarterly report to the board. These reports are read by the board, and sometimes directors will ask the PMC for clarification or to make suggestions for the project.
You can read the complete list of Apache Community Development board reports. A chronological view of all minutes from ASF Board meetings is also public.</description>
