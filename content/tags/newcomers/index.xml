Finding the right project &amp;para; The key to working on projects at Apache (and on any open source project, for that matter) is to have a personal reason for being involved.

      <description>Mentoring: First Patch &amp;para; A beginner&amp;rsquo;s first patch on a project can be an intimidating and frustrating experience.

Here&amp;rsquo;s some tips on how to do that.

Talk to the project first Make sure it&amp;rsquo;s wanted/welcome See if there&amp;rsquo;s already work in progress, or suggestions Find someone to be your advocate Finding the source Writing a good commit message Following up on your pull request Learning from your struggle: Improving the documentation </description>
