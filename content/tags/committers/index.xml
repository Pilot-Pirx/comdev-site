      <description>The addition of committers is essential to the long-term sustainability of an open source project. The PMC is responsible for determining who will be added as a committer.
Please see the formal policy and process documentation for adding committers. This page discusses best practices in how to think about new committers.
Who should be a committer? &amp;para; Each project must decide what is the correct measure for inviting a new committer to their project.</description>

      <description>Projects at the ASF offer a way to grow in your responsibilities in the project, from being a user, all the way up to being a maintainer of the project. While the specific details may look different from one project to another, the rungs of the ladder look mostly the same.

      <description>Read the mailing list Contribute code (and other things) End user support Documentation Review PRs and tickets Be visible Test, and vote on releases (non-binding) Give talks Disclaimer &amp;para; Nothing in this post should be construed as a guarantee. You can do everything listed here, for years, and still not become a committer. This is because the decision is made by individuals on the project PMC, who do things for their own reasons.</description>

      <description>There are a number of useful Apache tools and services available for Apache projects and committers. This is a brief set of pointers or signposts to that information.
Apache Infrastructure Information &amp;para; The primary portals for Apache Infra questions - how Subversion/Git/Websites, etc. work at the ASF - are pages at apache.org/dev and infra.apache.org.

      <description>Mentoring a new committer &amp;para; So I&amp;rsquo;m a committer now. What&amp;rsquo;s next? What rights do I have now that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have before? What are the social conventions around making a commit?

Here&amp;rsquo;s the basics that are true across (almost) all Apache projects.
