      <description>Occasionally a &amp;ldquo;feel&amp;rdquo; for consensus is not enough. Sometimes we need to have a measurable consensus, for example, when voting to invite new committers or to approve a release.
Preparing for a Vote &amp;para; It is important to ensure that the community has time to discuss the issue before voting. To do this, post an email to the list indicating the intention to call a vote and the options available. By the time a vote takes place there usually is consensus in the community on what path to take.</description>
