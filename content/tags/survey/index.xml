      <description>Over the next few weeks the Apache Community Development team will be sending out and running its first ever Apache Software Foundation Committer Diversity Survey. The committer group was selected because they are a significant number of people that are linked to every Apache project. (NOTE: The ASF currently has 5861 committers across 295 projects.)
Although there are many aspects to diversity including socio-economic, disability and education etc which may be addressed in future surveys, this initial survey will focus on the three broad areas of age, gender and ethnicity.</description>
