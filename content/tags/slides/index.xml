      <description>This page contains links to presentations and other key papers about the ASF and how Apache projects work that you may find useful. Many of these have been presented at ApacheCon conferences or other open source conferences.
These presentations are available under permissive licenses; please see each individual presentation for license details.
Many Apache speakers post their slides to the SlideShare website, and the FeatherCast podcast offers audio recordings of many talks and interviews.</description>
