      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of magic happening in the IoT sector at the moment. A lot of new projects are appearing and older projects are growing and extending their functionality. We have noticed that it&amp;rsquo;s currently quite difficult to keep track who the players in this field are and what they&amp;rsquo;re up to. So we decided to create a new mailing-list to help improve the communication:
iot@apache.org (Archive at: https://lists.apache.org/list.html?iot@apache.org)
We hope this communication-channel will help reduce unnecessary double-work and improve streamlining the projects to work together as good a possible.</description>
