      <description>A comprehensive guide to being a GSoC admin for the ASF
List of duties:
Make sure the ASF has an extensive list of project ideas ready shortly after Google announces the program (around the end of January). Projects must create Jira issues for their ideas and label them with gsoc&amp;lt;year&amp;gt;; and mentor. If a project doesn&amp;rsquo;t use Jira, have them create the ideas in the GSOC Jira project. Create a Jira filter for these ideas to use in the application (see next).</description>

      <title>Mentee Ranking Process</title>

      <description>This page describes the ranking process The Apache Software Foundation uses to evaluate mentee proposals.
The ranking process makes sure the most promising applicants get a mentor with an ASF project. The goal is not to identify the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; projects for the ASF, but the best mentees who have applied to the ASF.
Remember, mentoring is all about the mentee and open source as a whole. It is not about the mentors or their projects.</description>
